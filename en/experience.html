      For my second internship, I have the chance to work as a research
      assistant at the Reliable Silicon Systems Lab at McGill University. My
      task was to set up a machine learning development board and to figure
      out how to get a computer vision model to run on it. The development
      board was a Raspberry Pi with a camera module with a hardware
      acceleration chip for machine learning tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      During the internship, I implemented multiple computer vision models
      from published papers, such as LeNet and PortraitNet, using Tensorflow.
      Each model had to be quantized to 8-bit integers using Tensorflow Lite,
      before being processed and pacakged with the board's proprietary
      toolchain. Then, a C++ application would use the packaged model to run
      directly on the edge device.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      By the end, I had successfully implemented and run two computer vision
      models and a third one was in progress.

      Now that I felt comfortable with my software development skills and that
      I knew I could put my expertise to use, I joined the McGill Robotics
      Team. The team's slogan is "Inspiring students to build robots. Building
      robots to inspire students", which I think embodies perfectly my own
      vision of what engineering projects should be. The team currently has
      three projects: a Mars rover, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV),
      and a drone. I have chosen to work on the rover as I have always been
      interested in space and everything around it.

    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      For this internship I was tasked with developing a proof-of-concept for
      a web application related to indoor routing. During the development, I
      had to research the available technologies and make decisions as to
      which technologies were best suited for this project. I also had to
      adapt to some compatibility issues I encountered and instead opted for
      Docker containers for the back-end of the application.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      The application was developed in JavaScript with Yarn and Webpack. For
      the back-end, I used Docker Compose to create a PostgreSQL database, a
      PostgREST API, and a routing engine that would all three work together.
      The web application was deployed on an IIS server.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      At the end of the internship, the application was fully functional and
      responded to the clients' requirements.

      At the beginning of my second year of CEGEP, I was contacted as a

      understand things, I started tutoring.

    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      Since this was in the fall of 2020, the covid-related lockdowns were in
      effect and I had to tutor through videoconferencing sessions. This made
      the task somewhat more difficult, but I used the tools available to me
      to make the most out of this experience and to teach as best I could!
