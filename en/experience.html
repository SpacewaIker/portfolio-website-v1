      Now that I felt comfortable with my software development skills and that I knew I could put my expertise to use, I joined the McGill Robotics Team. The team's slogan is "Inspiring students to build robots. Building robots to inspire students", which I think embodies perfectly my own vision of what engineering projects should be. The team currently has three projects: a Mars rover, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and a drone. I have chosen to work on the rover as I have always been interested in space and everything around it.

      At the start of my second year, I was invited to join the brand new McGill club, Chap (Competitive Hackathons And Projects). The club's goal is to allow software engineering students to develop the skills necessary to produce top-of-the-line software projects, as well as providing a roster of engaged software developers with an interest in competing in hackathons. As a software engineering student, this is the perfect club for me to work on bigger projects and learn to work as part of a team, in addition to familiarizing myself with the tools and practices used in the industry. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      As of now, the club is still very new and its focus is on creating the foundation required for a university club to be successful. As such, the only project currently in development is the club's own website. However this is bound to change soon.

    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      For this internship I was tasked with developing a proof-of-concept for a web application related to indoor routing. During the development, I had to research the available technologies and make decisions as to which technologies were best suited for this project. I also had to adapt to some compatibility issues I encountered and instead opted for Docker containers for the back-end of the application. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      The application was developed in JavaScript with Yarn and Webpack. For the back-end, I used Docker Compose to create a PostgreSQL database, a PostgREST API, and a routing engine that would all three work together. The web application was deployed on an IIS server.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      At the end of the internship, the application was fully functional and responded to the clients' requirements.

      At the beginning of my second year of CEGEP, I was contacted as a potential tutor for the classes I was best at: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. As I enjoy helping other people learn and making people understand things, I started tutoring.

    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      Since this was in the fall of 2020, the covid-related lockdowns were in effect and I had to tutor through videoconferencing sessions. This made the task somewhat more difficult, but I used the tools available to me to make the most out of this experience and to teach as best I could!
