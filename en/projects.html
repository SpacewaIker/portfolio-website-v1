        One of the best ways to learn programming is through practicing and
        working on projects. Whether it is alone or in a team, for a course or
        a personal project, trying to create something is crucial to
        concretizing theoretical knowledge.

      To apply to the GameDev McGill club, I had to complete the Roll-a-Ball
      tutorial from Unity. I decided to do it in Unreal Engine 5, as I was
      more familiar with it. And as I found that a ball rolling about was a
      bit pointless, I changed it into a wizard character collecting items in
      a small village. You can run around, jump, rotate the top-down camera,
      and even get jump boosts on hay carts!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      As the goal of this project was to do a small project in a few days, I
      didn't do anything groundbreaking with it. However, I still learned more
      about making animations based on context (running, jumping, falling,
      etc.), and I learned how to use Unreal's Enhanced Input Plugin to handle
      user input well, including both keyboard and mouse and controller input.

      For this second project in Rust, I wanted to dive more seriously into
      game development. As such, I decided to follow Herbert Wolverson's
      <a href="https://hands-on-rust.com" target="_blank">Hands-on Rust</a>
      book, an introductory tutorial to creating a roguelike game in Rust. I
      however pushed my game much further by adding many more features,
      different game modes, more items, more enemies, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      The game is a turn-based roguelike dungeon crawler, where the player
      must find the Amulet of Sirref, a powerful artifact that will allow them
      to rid the world of evil monsters. The player must fight their way
      through the dungeon, defeating enemies and collecting items to help them
      on their quest, such as weapons, armor, potions, and special items.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      Overall, I am very proud of what I was able to accomplish in my first
      serious game development project. I also learned a lot about game
      development, such as how an entity-component-system architecture works,
      while further improving my Rust skills.

      Overall, I was impressed by the frameworks, given that the Rust language
      is still relatively new. The frameworks were quite similar to other web
      frameworks I've worked with in the past such as Spring and React, while
      retaining the Rust awesomeness. I had a lot of fun working on this small
      project through which I also learned a lot about Rust and WebAssembly.

      collaborate to create projects that have a purpose.

      A big part of the project was also to experience working in a large
      team, with 10 developers, and how to manage the project with the scrum
      framework. As such, we worked through two three-week sprints, where we
      managed the project backlog, refined tasks at the beginning of the
      sprints, held sprint planning meetings, etc. We also had a product owner
      to focus our efforts into making the project successful, and a scrum
      master to help the other developers if they encountered issues.

      We were also able to work on some more advanced features such as
      authentication, which is something that we often overlooked before due
      to time constraints.

      were developed with Test-Driven-Development, while for others we used

      come up with an AI-based application. My partner and I were interested
      in computer vision, and as such, decided to build an app where the user
      would draw shapes by waving their hand and making signs in front of a
      camera.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      We handled the full development of the app, from the gathering of the
      training data, to choice of which machine learning algorithm to use, and
      the building and training of the model. We decided to go for a decision
      tree algorithm for the classification of the hand signs, and we used
      MediaPipe's Hands library to extract the hand's position from the video
      stream. For the web app, we used StreamLit and PyVirtualCam as these
      libraries were straightforward and corresponded perfectly to our needs.

    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      As this was a team project, I developed my teamwork skills. Notably, I
      had to demonstrate good communication and time management skills due to
      some problems I encountered with my teammate. The code for the model
      training as well as a proof of concept web app are available on the
      GitHub repository. A DevPost page was also made for this project.

        Recreated the Pong game in Java with a physics simulation for the
        ball's movement.

        The game includes settings such as the opponent's difficulty, the

      For this project I recreated the classic Pong game in Java. This was my
      first project in Java and a more formal introduction to Object Oriented
      Programming. As such, the game was first developed with a
      functional/imperative programming style, and then later converted to an
      Object-Oriented Programming style. This allowed for easier maintenance
      of the code, as well as additional features, such as multiple balls
      simulation through multithreading.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      The game includes many features such as a scoring system with renamable
      players, colour settings for the ball and paddles, game settings, and
      keyboard shortcuts for actions like restarting the game, pausing the
      game, and quitting the game.

      As one of my bigger Python projects, I recreated the game of Snake with
      PyGame. This game includes sound effects when the snake eats a fruit and
      when it collides. The game also includes a high score feature and
      multiple snake speeds. The snake had multiple colour schemes.
