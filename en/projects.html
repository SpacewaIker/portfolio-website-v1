      This project is a management web application for a fictional museum that allows the management of the museum's items, employees, and customers. Items can be put in specific rooms or in storage and can be loaned by customers. Customers can also donate items to the museum. Employees can approve loans and donations in addition to putting items in and out of storage. Finally, the museum's owner can perform the same actions as the employees in addition to hiring and firing employees.

      As this project is more or less a follow-up to the <a href="./projects.html#divesafe-project">DiveSafe project</a>, the goals are similar: to learn about project management techniques while familiarizing ourselves with the tools used in the industry. As such, we will use a Kanban board to manage our tasks and a CI/CD pipeline through GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of our application. We will also use GitHub to collaborate on the project and to manage our code. Our backend will be written in Java using the Spring framework connected to a PostgreSQL database. Finally, our frontend will be written in JavaScript.

      During the summer I designed and built this very website. I took some online courses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery to get started and learned the rest along the way.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      I first designed the website in Figma, at which point I decided on a design that was interactive and fun, yet simple and functional. I also chose a color palette, the fonts I would use and what content I would include. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      After this, I started prototyping some parts of the website such as the menu popup on mobile, the horizontally-scrolling timeline, and the title animation. This allowed me to get more comfortable with JavaScript as well as starting to build pieces of the website. I then started to build the complete website.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      Through a lot of creative thinking, problem solving, and dedication, I was able to finish the website before the start of the Fall 2022 semester, and the beginning of the internship application season.

      The DiveSafe desktop application is a management application for a fictional diving company. It can manage club members, diving guides and their schedules, member trips, and equipment rental. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      The purpose of this project was to experiment with popular design pattern and development styles. As such, the application's architecture was based on the Model-View-Controller pattern. The Model was built from a UML diagram and the Java classes were automatically generated from a model description using the Umple tool. Some parts of the Controller were developed with Test-Driven-Development, while for others we used Behavior-Driven-Development. For the former, we used JUnit, and for the latter, we used Cucumber and Gherkin user stories. Finally, for the graphical user interface, we used JavaFX.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      I also designed and created the application's logo which you can see above!

      This project was the final assignment for the McGill Artificial Intelligence Society's "MAIS&nbsp;202" AI bootcamp. The goal of this assignment was to  use all that we learned throughout the bootcamp to come up with an AI-based application. My partner and I were interested in computer vision, and as such, decided to build an app where the user would draw shapes by waving their hand and making signs in front of a camera.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      We handled the full development of the app, from the gathering of the training data, to choice of which machine learning algorithm to use, and the building and training of the model. We decided to go for a decision tree algorithm for the classification of the hand signs, and we used MediaPipe's Hands library to extract the hand's position from the video stream. For the web app, we used StreamLit and PyVirtualCam as these libraries were straightforward and corresponded perfectly to our needs.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      As this was a team project, I developed my teamwork skills. Notably, I had to demonstrate good communication and time management skills due to some problems I encountered with my teammate. The code for the model training as well as a proof of concept web app are available on the GitHub repository. A DevPost page was also made for this project.

      For this project I recreated the classic Pong game in Java. This was my first project in Java and a more formal introduction to Object Oriented Programming. As such, the game was first developed with a functional/imperative programming style, and then later converted to an Object-Oriented Programming style. This allowed for easier maintenance of the code, as well as additional features, such as multiple balls simulation through multithreading. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content with-image">
      The game includes many features such as a scoring system with renamable players, colour settings for the ball and paddles, game settings, and keyboard shortcuts for actions like restarting the game, pausing the game, and quitting the game.
