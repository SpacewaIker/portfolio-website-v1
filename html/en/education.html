      <p class="paragraph">Learning through projects is arguably the best way to learn programming; however, solely learning through projects will leave you without the theoretical basis on which programming knowledge thrives. Indeed, I believe that learning about core topics in mathematics, engineering, and computer science will allow a software engineer to understand <i>why</i> something works or <i>how</i> to make it work, faster, making them better at what they do.</p>

      It seems that every time I progress in my education curriculum, I find myself enjoying more the position I'm in. When I went from high school to college/CEGEP, I enjoyed the additional freedom and the more advanced topics I was learning about. And when I got to university, I knew I was on the right track; what was previously a hobby of mine that I used to get away from the stress of school was now the main focus of my studies, and was what professors were teaching me!

      In my first semester, I enrolled in the McGill Artificial Intelligence Society's "MAIS 202" bootcamp, an accelerated introduction to AI and ML. You can learn more about my learning experience below.

      Thankfully, McGill will be back to full in-person classes and activities this next semester, and I will be able to experience more of the student life.

      The McGill Artificial Intelligence Society is a student-lead community of AI enthusiasts with the goal of learning and teaching, fostering the AI community, and connecting students with the industry. Their "MAIS 202" bootcamp is a two-month accelerated introduction to AI and ML with assignments and classes worth a full course load.

      The final assignment for this bootcamp was to build an AI-based project, that we completed in pairs. The project that I worked on is described in the <a href="./projects.html#airdraw-project">projects page</a>.

      During my two years in CEGEP, I focused mainly on my studies, even though I began to learn programming on the side. This was my first time going to an English-speaking school as a native French speaker. As such, there was a bit of getting used to, but I was quickly comfortable with learning in English.

      In my second year, I began to do some tutoring in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. I also participated in the Canadian Open Mathematical Challenge and received Performance with Honours.

      At the middle of my second semester, the first covid quarantining started. From then, the rest of my college studies were remote. Once teachers and students got used to remote learning/teaching, I used this opportunity to improve my autodidactic skills and my autonomy.
