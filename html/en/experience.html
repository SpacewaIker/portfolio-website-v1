    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      For this internship I was tasked with developing a proof-of-concept for a web application related to indoor routing. During the development, I had to research the available technologies and make decisions as to which technologies were best suited for this project. I also had to adapt to some compatibility issues I encountred and instead opted for Docker containers for the back-end of the application. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      The application was developed in JavaScript with Yarn and Webpack. For the back-end, I used Docker Compose to create a PostgrSQL database, a PostgREST API, and a routing engine that would all three work together. The web application was deployed on an IIS server.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      At the end of the internship, the application was fully functional and responded to the clients' requirements.
