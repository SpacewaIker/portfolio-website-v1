    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      For this internship I was tasked with developing a proof-of-concept for a web application related to indoor routing. During the development, I had to research the available technologies and make decisions as to which technologies were best suited for this project. I also had to adapt to some compatibility issues I encountered and instead opted for Docker containers for the back-end of the application. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      The application was developed in JavaScript with Yarn and Webpack. For the back-end, I used Docker Compose to create a PostgreSQL database, a PostgREST API, and a routing engine that would all three work together. The web application was deployed on an IIS server.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      At the end of the internship, the application was fully functional and responded to the clients' requirements.

      At the beginning of my second year of CEGEP, I was contacted as a potential tutor for the classes I was best at: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. As I enjoy helping other people learn and making people understand things, I started tutoring.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph cv-content">
      Since this was in the fall of 2020, the covid-related lockdowns were in effect and I had to tutor through videoconferencing sessions. This made the task somewhat more difficult, but I used the tools available to me to make the most out of this experience and to teach as best I could!
